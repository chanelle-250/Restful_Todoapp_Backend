# Todo List REST API Backend

This project is a RESTful Todo List Backend API built with Java 17 and Spring Boot. It provides a secure, scalable backend for managing tasks, with full JWT-based authentication and PostgreSQL integration.

The API allows users to:

✅ Register and log in securely using JWT tokens

📝 Create, update, and delete tasks

🔍 Filter and search tasks

🛡️ Protect all routes with authentication

⚙️ Easily integrate with any frontend (e.g. React, Angular, mobile apps)

This backend is ideal for learning modern backend development with Spring Boot or building production-level task management systems.
